#📘Learnings

This repository is my evolving notebook vault – a personal documentation hub for everything I learn across Python, data science and AI.

Each folder focuses on a core area of learning, with hands-on Jupyter Notebooks that explain concepts, show code, and offer experiments and visualizations.

## 📌 Purpose

This is not just a repo—it's a growing archive of learnings, mistakes, breakthroughs, and mental models. It exists to:

- Clarify concepts for myself 🧠
- Serve as a reference for future projects 🔁
- Help others who are on a similar path 👥


## Usage

- Review notebooks by topic to understand specific Python concepts.
- Execute notebooks to interact with code and follow along with exercises.
- Clone or fork the repository for individual learning and practice.

## Notes

- This repository does not contain completed projects or production-level code.
- Notebooks are updated as learning progresses.

> ⚠️ Work in Progress: This repo will evolve over time.
