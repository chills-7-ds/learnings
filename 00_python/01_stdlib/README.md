# **Python Standard Library Learning Series**

---

## **Overview**

This repository is a structured collection of all the **Python Standard Library (stdlib)** modules I have learned and implemented through individual, minimalist projects.
Each module includes:

* Clear concept explanations
* Practical examples
* Interview-focused functions
* A small, working project showcasing real-world use

Every concept and its project are documented in detail in Notion for easy review and understanding.

---

## **Goal**

To gain strong command over essential Python standard libraries that form the foundation of real-world programming and problem-solving.

## **Covered Standard Libraries**

| Module                    | Core Learning Focus                                                 |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **datetime**              | Working with dates, times, formatting, and timestamps               |
| **os**                    | File/directory handling, environment variables, and path operations |
| **argparse**              | Building command-line interfaces (CLI) with argument parsing        |
| **sys**                   | System-specific parameters and standard I/O handling                |
| **re**                    | Regular expressions for pattern matching and text extraction        |
| **random & secrets**      | Generating random values â€” pseudo and cryptographically secure      |
| **hashlib**               | Creating secure hashes for passwords and data integrity             |
| **time**                  | Measuring execution time and adding delays                          |
| **collections**           | Efficient data structures (Counter, defaultdict, deque, namedtuple) |
| **itertools & functools** | Functional-style programming tools and iterators                    |
| **json, csv & pickle**    | Serialization, data storage, and file exchange formats              |
| **logging**               | Event tracking, debugging, and error recording                      |

## **Structure**

Each library has:

* A learning section (concepts + examples)
* A small hands-on project
* A clean README or Notion link summarizing takeaways and real-world usage

---

## **Learning Format**

* **Approach:** Practical, concise, and progressive learning
* **Use Cases:** CLI utilities, automation, secure generation, data handling
* **Focus:** Interview-ready clarity and real-world application
* **Documentation:** Each stdlib module documented in the same Notion workspace

---

## **How to Use**

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <your_repo_url>
cd python-stdlib-series
```

Each moduleâ€™s folder contains:

```
- main_script.py
- README.md
```

---

## **Notion Learning Space**

All standard library notes and projects are documented, Read the Notion link for in-depth explanations and walkthroughs.

---

## **End Goal**

By completing this series, the aim is to:

* Understand Pythonâ€™s built-in capabilities deeply.
* Build a toolkit of small, efficient programs.
* Be fully prepared for interview questions involving stdlib modules.
