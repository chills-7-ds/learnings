    "The standard library is a collection of pre-installed modules and packages that come with Python. \n",
    "It provides a wide range of functionality, such as file I/O, math operations, data manipulation, and more.\n",
    "It includes modules like math, os, sys, datetime, json, etc.\n",
    "Standard libraries that i thought of covering for now are : datetime, os, argparse, sys, re, random & secrets, hashlib, time, collections, itertools & functools, json & csv & pickle and logging.\n",

    "Scope: A module is a single file, while a library is a collection of multiple modules and packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Purpose: Modules are used to organize and reuse code within a specific context, whereas libraries provide a broader set of functionalities that can be used across different applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Structure: Modules are simple files with a .py extension, while libraries can contain multiple modules, packages, and sub-packages.\n",
